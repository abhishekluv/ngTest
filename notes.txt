Purpose of Testing:
-------------------

Testing is a critical part of the software development process aimed at ensuring software reliability and robustness by identifying and resolving defects before the product reaches the end-user.

It helps maintain code quality and improve performance, which in turn ensures user satisfaction and reduces maintenance costs.

Jasmine:
--------

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

It is independent of any other frameworks and doesnâ€™t require a DOM, making it ideal for testing any JavaScript functionality.

Karma:
------


Karma is a test runner developed by the Angular team that allows you to execute tests written in Jasmine, Mocha, or QUnit.

It can be configured to run tests against a variety of real browsers and devices, and it is particularly well-suited for Angular applications.

Demos:

- Installing Jasmine and karma and jasmine: automatically installed by angular CLI command "ng new .."
- configure jasmine and karma: automatically configured by angular CLI command "ng new .."
- run tests: ng test(starts karma test runner)
- setting up Angular TestBed
- example 1 
  1. testing a simple method in a service
  2. create math.service.ts
  3. create math.service.spec.ts
- example 2
  1. testing component property binding
  2. app.component.ts
  3. app.component.spec.ts
- example 3
  1. testing event binding: designed to verify that clicking the button correctly increments the count property
  2. click.component.ts
  3. click.component.spec.ts
